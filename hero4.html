      <b><h2>Career</h2></b>
      <h2> Debut, breakthrough, and commercial success</h2>
      <p align=justify>Prabhas started his film career with Eeswar (2002). In 2003, he was the lead in Raghavendra.

        In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu. He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the former.

        In 2005, he appeared in Chakram and in the film Chatrapathi, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, in which he portrays the role of a refugee, exploited by goons. It had a 100-day run in 54 centers. Idlebrain.com stated that he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence. Chatrapathi earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.</p>
      <p align=justify>Later, he starred in the dance drama Pournami (2006), the action film Yogi (2007) and the action drama Munna (2007). This was followed by the action-comedy Bujjigadu in 2008. In 2009, his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa "stylish and visually rich".[28] Ek Niranjan earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

        In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."</p>

        <h2>Baahubali and success</h2>
        <p align=justify>In 2015, Prabhas appeared as Shivudu/Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali in S.S. Rajamouli's epic action drama Baahubali: The Beginning which is the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film to date. The film started a new film movement named pan-India films. Prabhas reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over ₹1,000 crore (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days, and is the second-highest-grossing Indian film to date.[43][44][45] He won the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in The Conclusion.[46] He increased his weight to 105 kg for Baahubali's character. His performance in both film earned him his sixth and seventh nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.</p>
        <p align=justify>Prabhas's dialogue 'okka adugu' (one step) in SS Rajamouli's Chatrapathi (2005), is still considered one of his memorable ones. The following dialogue by LB Sriram, who played an important character in the film, sealed the deal. He tells Prabhas, "Thippara meesam (Twirl your moustache)." Those who doubted Prabhas's acting ability, changed their mind after this scene.</p>

        <h2>Career fluctuations</h2>
        <p align=justify>In 2019, Prabhas starred alongside Shraddha Kapoor in the Sujeeth-directed action thriller Saaho. It received unfavourable reviews from critics, but went on to gross over ₹433 crore. In 2022, Prabhas starred in the period romance film Radhe Shyam directed by Radha Krishna Kumar which received negative reviews from critics & proved to be a box office bomb. In 2023, Prabhas starred as Lord Ram in the mythological action film Adipurush, based on the Ramayana.
