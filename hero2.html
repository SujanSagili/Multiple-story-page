Idlebrain wrote: "Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half."[42] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated that "Arjun performs well though he is rather subdued."[43] Allu Arjun won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second Nandi Special Jury Award.

After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi in 2011.[67] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."[68] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance."[69] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu), for his performance in the film.</p>

His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[71][72] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).</p>
